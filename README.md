#### Dependency Injection :
The process of constructing required dependecies(objects/entities/instances)out side the dependent object and providing them to the dependent when needed.

##### SOLID
The term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software design more understandable, flexible and maintainable.
##### S O L I D :
S: Single Responsibility Principle; A class should have only one job to do,That means a class should have only one reason to change. And to make a new change you need to change only one place.  
O: Open/Closed Principle; Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
L: Liskov Substitution Principle; This principle is about child classes. Every child/sub class should be a substitution for their original parent class.  
I: Interface Segregation Principle; A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or a client shouldn't be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
D: Dependency Inversion Principle; Entities must depend on abstraction, not on concretion.
